##Gameplay

Starz Puzzle is a strategy game where you have a limited amount of time to collect all the stars on a given level.<br/>
Some blocks will hinder you. Make smart moves to clear your path.<br/>

Warning! You can only push blocks, not pull them. <br/>
The longer it takes you to collect stars, the lower the points you are getting. <br/>
Hurry up, clock is ticking! <br/>
