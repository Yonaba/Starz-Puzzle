##Gameplay

Starz Puzzle is a action/strategy-based game.
You have a limited amount of time to collect all the stars of a given level.
Some blocks will hinder you and you will smart moves to clear your path.

Warning! You can only push blocks, not pull them.
And also you cannot push two blocks simultaneously, nor send a block over a star.
And hurry up, for the clock is ticking!
The longer it takes, the lesser points you will earn collecting stars.
